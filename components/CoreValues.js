          <b>Openness:</b>
          without new ideas or understanding new perspectives, it is
          impossible to improve and evolve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tolerance:</b>
          I believe that we can only work together on the long run, if
          we are willing to understand and accept others opinion and identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mutual respect:</b>
          when we work together, it's important to value each other's
          work, and their energy and time they put into it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
