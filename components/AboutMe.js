        I'm a software developer with a wide range of knowledge and interests.
        My current position is <b>Site Reliability Engineer</b>, but I'm
        basically around DevOps for more than 8 years now. Originally I've
        started in web development, but then started to shift my career towards
        DevOps; I'm also interested in topics like cyber security, and because
        of this I'm more than capable in helping and advising in any part of
        the development lifecycle. Most of my experience is in managing
        services running on AWS and Kubernetes, but I have used GCP as well
        in some of my pet-projects. Building CI/CD pipelines and realizing
        savings in infrastructural costs are also high on my list.

      <p>
        Mindenem a tanulás és tudom, hogy a több területet átölelő
        érdeklődésem segít abban hogy a lehető legjobb megoldás felé
        tereljem magamat és azokat, akikkel együtt dolgozom.
      </p>

        Learning and keeping up with technology is important to me, and I
        know that my wide range of interests helps me redirecting myself and
        the people I work with towards the best possible solutions.
